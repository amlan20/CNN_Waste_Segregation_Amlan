# CNN_Waste_Segregation_Amlan

Data Description

The dataset consists of multiple folders, each representing a specific class, such as Cardboard, Food_Waste, and Metal.
Within each folder, there are images of objects that belong to that category.
However, these items are not further subcategorised.
For instance, the Food_Waste folder may contain images of items like coffee grounds, teabags, and fruit peels, without explicitly stating that they are actually coffee grounds or teabags.
